# ruby-web-automation

These are some ruby web automation scripts I made while learning for a GSoC project idea.
Technologies Used: Ruby, Selenium, RSpec, and Cucumber

1. The hello feature file is the first script I made while learning from a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKe1_z6JJ2w&list=PLVW-kPgfwguy6TAa3LmZVytn-RnGG1Wpw&index=6)
2. The Jenkins steps feature file Automates the action of logging into jenkins and creating a new freestyle job
3. The Google search steps file goes to the google web search page and automatically searches a custom string
4. The Instagram feature file simulates logging in to instagram using valid as well as invalid credentials
